# Multi-Search Feature Implementation âœ…

## Overview
Successfully implemented persistent multi-search functionality that allows users to perform multiple radius searches and see them all simultaneously on the map. Each search remains active until manually removed, with individual controls for visibility and map features.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Persistent Multiple Radius Circles on Map
**Files Modified:** `MapMarkers.jsx`, `MapContainer.jsx`

- All radius searches now remain visible on the map simultaneously
- Active search highlighted in red, others in gray with dashed borders
- Each circle can be individually toggled on/off
- Center markers scaled based on active/inactive state

### 2. Search History Chips (Already Implemented)
**Location:** Top of search area in `RadiusSearch.jsx`

Features per chip:
- **Label format:** "75034 - Frisco, TX (10m)"
- **Remove button (X):** Delete individual searches
- **Click to focus:** Centers map on that search area
- **Dropdown menu** with controls for:
  - Enable/disable radius overlay
  - Show/hide markers
  - Show/hide ZIP borders

### 3. Search History Panel in Results Drawer
**New Component:** `SearchHistoryPanel.jsx`

Added a new "Searches" tab to the results drawer that shows:
- List of all performed searches with timestamps
- Individual controls for each search:
  - **Focus button:** Centers map on search area
  - **Toggle Radius:** Show/hide radius circle
  - **Toggle Markers:** Show/hide center marker
  - **Toggle ZIP Borders:** Show/hide ZIP boundaries for that area
- **Fit All Searches** button to zoom out and show all searches
- Visual indication of active search
- Trash icon to remove searches

### 4. Map Visualization Updates
**Changes to:** `MapMarkers.jsx`

Each search on the map shows:
- **Active search (red):**
  - Solid border, 2.5px weight
  - Higher opacity (0.15)
  - Larger center marker (20px)

- **Inactive searches (gray):**
  - Dashed border, 1.5px weight
  - Lower opacity (0.08)
  - Smaller center marker (16px)

- **Popup on markers** showing:
  - Search label
  - Location details
  - Radius distance
  - Timestamp

## User Workflow

1. **Perform a search** - Creates a radius circle on map
2. **Perform another search** - Adds another circle, both remain visible
3. **Click search chips** at top to:
   - Focus on specific search area
   - Toggle individual display settings
4. **Use Searches tab** in drawer to:
   - See all searches in list format
   - Control visibility of each element
   - Focus or fit all searches in view
5. **Remove searches** individually via X button or trash icon

## Technical Implementation

### State Management
The SearchContext now maintains:
```javascript
radiusSearches: [
  {
    id: 'unique-id',
    label: '75034 - Frisco, TX (10m)',
    center: [lat, lng],
    radius: 10,
    settings: {
      showRadius: true,
      showMarkers: true,
      showZipBorders: false
    },
    timestamp: Date.now()
  }
]
```

### Key Functions
- `executeRadiusSearchFromHistory()` - Re-runs a search from history
- `updateRadiusSearchSettings()` - Updates individual search display settings
- `removeRadiusSearch()` - Removes a search from history
- `handleFitAllSearches()` - Calculates bounds to show all searches

## Visual Differentiation

| Feature | Active Search | Inactive Searches |
|---------|--------------|------------------|
| Circle Color | Red (#dc2626) | Gray (#6b7280) |
| Circle Border | Solid, 2.5px | Dashed, 1.5px |
| Circle Opacity | 0.15 | 0.08 |
| Marker Size | 20px | 16px |
| Marker Color | Red | Gray |
| Chip Highlight | Red background | Gray background |

## Benefits

1. **Visual Comparison** - See multiple search areas simultaneously
2. **Persistent Context** - Searches remain until explicitly removed
3. **Individual Control** - Each search has independent display settings
4. **Easy Navigation** - Quick focus on any search area
5. **Overview Capability** - "Fit All" shows entire search scope
6. **Clean Organization** - Dedicated tab for search management

## Testing the Feature

1. **Multiple Searches:**
   - Perform 2-3 radius searches in different areas
   - All circles should remain visible on map

2. **Chip Interaction:**
   - Click chips to focus on searches
   - Use dropdown to toggle settings
   - Remove searches with X button

3. **Drawer Panel:**
   - Open "Searches" tab in results drawer
   - Test Focus, toggle buttons
   - Try "Fit All Searches" with multiple searches

4. **Visual Feedback:**
   - Active search shows in red
   - Inactive searches show in gray with dashed lines
   - Settings persist per search

## Future Enhancements

1. **Search Comparison Mode** - Compare results between 2-3 searches
2. **Color Coding** - Assign different colors to each search
3. **Search Groups** - Group related searches together
4. **Export/Import** - Save search configurations
5. **Animation** - Smooth transitions when focusing searches
6. **Statistics** - Show result counts per search area

The multi-search feature is now fully implemented and operational! Users can perform multiple searches, see them all on the map simultaneously, and manage each one individually through both the chip interface and the dedicated searches panel in the results drawer.
