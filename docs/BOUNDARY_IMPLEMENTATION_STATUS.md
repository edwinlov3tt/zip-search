# Boundary Implementation Status

## Overview
This document provides a comprehensive review of the boundary functionality (ZIP, county, state, city boundaries) in the ZIP Search application, comparing what's implemented versus what needs to be done.

## Current API Endpoints

### ‚úÖ Existing Endpoints
1. **ZIP Boundaries**
   - `/api/v1/boundaries/zip.js` - Get ZIP boundary by code
   - `/api/v1/boundaries/zip/[code].js` - Dynamic route for ZIP boundaries
   - Uses Supabase RPC: `get_zip_boundary`

2. **State Boundaries**
   - `/api/v1/boundaries/state.js` - Get state boundary by code
   - `/api/v1/boundaries/state/[code].js` - Dynamic route for state boundaries
   - Uses Supabase RPC: `get_state_boundary`

3. **County Boundaries**
   - `/api/v1/boundaries/county.js` - Get county boundary by name and state
   - Uses Supabase RPC: `get_county_boundary`

4. **Cities Endpoint (Non-boundary)**
   - `/api/v1/cities.js` - Get city data (but NOT boundaries)

### ‚ùå Missing Endpoints
1. **City Boundaries**
   - No `/api/v1/boundaries/city.js` endpoint
   - City boundary fetching not implemented in API layer
   - Would need Supabase RPC: `get_city_boundary`

## Service Layer Implementation

### ‚úÖ Existing Services
All three boundary services exist and are ready to use:
1. `/src/services/zipBoundariesService.js`
2. `/src/services/stateBoundariesService.js`
3. `/src/services/cityBoundariesService.js`

## Frontend Implementation Status

### Current State (New Refactored App)
The refactored application has the following boundary features:

#### ‚úÖ What's Working
1. **UI Controls**
   - Boundary toggles exist in `BoundarySettings.jsx`
   - Show/hide toggles for all boundary types
   - Cache statistics display for ZIP boundaries
   - Clear cache functionality

2. **State Management**
   - MapContext has state variables for all boundary types:
     - `showCountyBorders`, `countyBoundaries`
     - `showZipBoundaries`, `zipBoundariesData`
     - `showStateBoundaries`, `stateBoundariesData`
     - `showCityBoundaries`, `cityBoundariesData`

3. **Static Files**
   - `/public/boundaries/us-counties.geojson` (3.2MB) - County boundaries ready
   - `/public/boundaries/us-zip-codes.geojson` - Empty placeholder

#### ‚ùå What's Missing
1. **Boundary Loading Logic**
   - No functions to actually load boundaries when toggled
   - No viewport-based loading for ZIP boundaries
   - No result-based loading for state/city boundaries
   - County boundaries not loaded from static file

2. **Service Integration**
   - Boundary services not imported or used in components
   - No connection between UI toggles and data fetching

3. **Map Display**
   - `BoundaryLayers` component exists but not receiving data
   - No rendering of boundary polygons on the map

## Implementation Gap Analysis

### Original GeoApplication.jsx Implementation
The original component had these features we need to port:

1. **County Boundaries**
   ```javascript
   loadCountyBoundaries() - Fetches from /boundaries/us-counties.geojson
   ```

2. **ZIP Boundaries**
   ```javascript
   loadZipBoundariesForViewport() - Viewport-based loading
   loadBoundariesForSearchResults() - Load boundaries for search results
   ```

3. **State Boundaries**
   ```javascript
   loadStateBoundariesForResults() - Load boundaries for displayed state results
   ```

4. **City Boundaries**
   ```javascript
   loadCityBoundariesForResults() - Load boundaries for displayed city results
   ```

### What Needs to Be Done

#### 1. Create City Boundaries API Endpoint ‚ö†Ô∏è PRIORITY
```javascript
// Create /api/v1/boundaries/city.js
// Similar structure to county.js but for cities
// Will need Supabase RPC function: get_city_boundary
```

#### 2. Integrate Boundary Services in Components üî¥ HIGH PRIORITY
- Import boundary services in appropriate components
- Connect MapContext state to actual data fetching
- Wire up toggle switches to trigger loading

#### 3. Implement Loading Functions üî¥ HIGH PRIORITY
Need to add these to SearchContext or create a BoundaryContext:
- `loadCountyBoundaries()` - Load from static file
- `loadZipBoundariesForViewport()` - Viewport-based ZIP loading
- `loadStateBoundariesForResults()` - Load for state results
- `loadCityBoundariesForResults()` - Load for city results

#### 4. Connect to Map Display üî¥ HIGH PRIORITY
- Ensure BoundaryLayers component receives boundary data
- Verify GeoJSON rendering on Leaflet map
- Handle boundary click interactions

## Quick Implementation Plan

### Step 1: Create City Boundary Endpoint
1. Create `/api/v1/boundaries/city.js`
2. Implement similar to county endpoint
3. Test with city/state parameters

### Step 2: Add Loading Logic
1. Import boundary services in MapContainer or create BoundaryProvider
2. Add useEffect hooks to load boundaries when toggles change
3. Implement viewport-based loading for ZIPs

### Step 3: Wire Up Components
1. Pass boundary data to BoundaryLayers component
2. Ensure proper GeoJSON rendering
3. Test all boundary types

### Step 4: Optimization
1. Implement proper caching
2. Add loading states
3. Handle errors gracefully

## Testing Checklist
- [ ] County boundaries load from static file
- [ ] ZIP boundaries load for viewport
- [ ] ZIP boundaries load for search results
- [ ] State boundaries load for visible states
- [ ] City boundaries load for visible cities
- [ ] All boundaries render correctly on map
- [ ] Toggle switches work properly
- [ ] Cache clearing works
- [ ] Performance is acceptable with multiple layers

## Notes
- All Supabase RPC functions seem to be in place except `get_city_boundary`
- The service layer is complete and ready to use
- Main work needed is wiring up the frontend components
- Consider implementing progressive loading for better performance
