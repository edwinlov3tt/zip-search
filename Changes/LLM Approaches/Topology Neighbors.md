You're on the right track—and yes, this makes sense. A pure “+1 mile buffer” works, but it’s a blunt instrument. The most robust (and explainable) way is to detect **adjacent ZIP polygons** (“touching” neighbors) and present those as *suggested* ZIPs (greyed out) that users can add.

Here are three practical options—ranked by quality:

# 1) Topology-true neighbors (best)

**Goal:** “Show ZIPs that share a boundary with any ZIP already in the user’s radius.”

**How:**

* Build the user shape `S` (circle or polygon).
* Find the set `A` = all ZIP polygons that intersect `S`.
* Find `N` = all ZIP polygons that **touch** any ZIP in `A` but are **not** in `A`.

**Implementation notes (Leaflet + Turf):**

* Use a small epsilon buffer (e.g., **50 m**) to avoid sliver/topology issues in TIGER ZCTAs.
* Prefer a “touches” test (shared boundary) over centroid distance.
* To avoid false positives from corner-touching only, require **shared boundary length > threshold** (e.g., >100 m).

**Pseudo/JS (Turf):**

```js
import bbox from '@turf/bbox';
import booleanIntersects from '@turf/boolean-intersects';
import booleanContains from '@turf/boolean-contains';
import polygonToLine from '@turf/polygon-to-line';
import lineOverlap from '@turf/line-overlap';
import buffer from '@turf/buffer';
import rbush from 'rbush';

// 1) Build a spatial index on ZIP polygons by bbox for speed.
const index = rbush();
index.load(allZipGeojson.features.map(f => {
  const [minX, minY, maxX, maxY] = bbox(f);
  return { minX, minY, maxX, maxY, f };
}));

// helper: query candidates by bbox
function queryByBbox(geom) {
  const [minX, minY, maxX, maxY] = bbox(geom);
  return index.search({ minX, minY, maxX, maxY }).map(r => r.f);
}

// 2) ZIPs intersecting the user shape S
function zipsInsideShape(S) {
  const candidates = queryByBbox(S);
  return candidates.filter(z => booleanIntersects(z, S));
}

// 3) Neighbor ZIPs that share a boundary with set A
function neighborZips(A) {
  // dissolve A by union buffer(0) to stabilize geometry (optional)
  const Aset = new Set(A.map(z => z.properties.ZCTA5CE10 || z.properties.GEOID || z.properties.ZIP));
  const neighbors = new Map(); // id -> feature

  for (const z of A) {
    const zLine = polygonToLine(z);
    const cand = queryByBbox(z); // bbox search around z
    for (const other of cand) {
      const id = other.properties.ZCTA5CE10 || other.properties.GEOID || other.properties.ZIP;
      if (Aset.has(id)) continue; // already included
      // quick reject: must at least bbox-touch & polygon-intersect after tiny buffer
      const touch = lineOverlap(polygonToLine(other), zLine, { tolerance: 1e-6 });
      // lineOverlap returns MultiLineString of overlaps; check length threshold
      if (touch && turf.length(touch, { units: 'kilometers' }) > 0.1 /* ~100m */) {
        neighbors.set(id, other);
      }
    }
  }
  return [...neighbors.values()];
}

// usage:
const included = zipsInsideShape(userShape);   // A
const suggested = neighborZips(included);      // N

// style in Leaflet:
// - A (included): normal fill (e.g., red)
// - N (suggested): grey fill, click to “Add”
```

**Why this is better than “+1 mile”**

* Finds **true border neighbors** (even if very thin) without over-pulling ZIPs across rivers/highways where the boundary is close but not touching.
* The shared-boundary length threshold prevents “corner kiss” false positives.

# 2) Ring buffer around the selected ZIP union (good/fast fallback)

**Goal:** “Suggest ZIPs just outside the selected area.”

**How:**

* Union (or just keep as a collection) of `A` (selected ZIP polygons).
* Make a **small buffer** around that union, e.g., **250–500 m** (not 1 mile).
* Suggested = ZIPs that **intersect the small buffer** but **don’t intersect the original union**.

**Turf sketch:**

```js
import union from '@turf/union';
import difference from '@turf/difference';
import buffer from '@turf/buffer';
import booleanIntersects from '@turf/boolean-intersects';

// (Optionally) union A to one geometry, or skip union for speed and treat as multi.
const Aunion = A.reduce((acc, f) => acc ? union(acc, f) : f, null);

// narrow ring outside A
const ring = difference(buffer(Aunion, 0.5, { units: 'kilometers' }), Aunion);

const suggested = queryByBbox(ring).filter(z =>
  !booleanIntersects(z, Aunion) && booleanIntersects(z, ring)
);
```

**Pros:** Simple, robust to messy topology.
**Cons:** Distance-based; may suggest ZIPs that are close but don’t actually border.

# 3) Precomputed ZIP adjacency graph (fastest at runtime)

**Goal:** Zero heavy geometry work in the browser.

**How:**

* Offline (one-time), build a `neighbors.json` mapping ZIP → \[adjacent ZIPs] using shapefiles (PostGIS `ST_Touches` or ogr/GEOS).
* At runtime:

  * Compute `A` (intersections with `S`).
  * Suggested = `union(neighbors[z] for z in A) - A`.

**Notes:**

* Lightning fast for your Leaflet app.
* Quality equals your offline topology rules (use shared boundary length threshold there too).
* Update only when TIGER/ZCTA changes.

## Which should you pick?

* If you want **accuracy** and can afford some per-interaction CPU: **#1 (touching boundaries)**.
* If you want **simple + reliable UX** and don’t need strict topology: **#2 (narrow ring buffer 250–500 m)**.
* If you want **max performance at scale**: **#3 (precomputed neighbors)**, with #1’s rules applied offline.

---

## Styling / UX in Leaflet

* Render included ZIPs (set `A`) as your normal style.
* Render suggested neighbors (`N`) with **low-opacity grey fill**, dashed border.
* On hover: show “Suggested (borders selected area)”.
* On click: “Add ZIP” → move from `N` to `A` and restyle live.
* Provide a toggle: “Show suggested bordering ZIPs”.

```js
function styleZip(f) {
  const id = f.properties.GEOID;
  if (includedIds.has(id)) return { color:'#cf0e0f', weight:2, fillOpacity:0.2 };
  if (suggestedIds.has(id)) return { color:'#888', dashArray:'4,4', weight:1, fillOpacity:0.05 };
  return { opacity:0 }; // or don’t render others
}
```

## Using lat/longs you already have

If you only have **ZIP centroids** (lat/long):

* Build a **spatial index** (k-d tree with `geokdbush`) of all centroids.
* For each included ZIP, fetch nearest centroids within, say, **3–5 km** and test those ZIP polygons with method #1 or #2 to confirm adjacency before suggesting. This drastically reduces polygon checks.

---

## Performance tips

* Always **bbox-index** your ZIP polygons (rbush) to limit pairwise checks.
* Convert polygons → **lines** and use overlap length to confirm real border sharing.
* Add a debounce when recomputing on map drag/resize.
* Cache results per radius/polygon hash when users tweak radii slightly.

---

### Bottom line

Skip the big 1-mile blanket. Use **adjacency (touching)** with a tiny epsilon and a shared-edge threshold. That gives you precise, defensible “neighbors you might want” and clean UX (greyed suggestions) without bloating results.
